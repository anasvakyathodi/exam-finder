# Exam Finder

This is a Reverse Engineered website which makes students of MANUU easy to check and download their exam results. It gives individual as well group results.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Edit the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Access [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). Edit this endpoint in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
